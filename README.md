# phone
# A project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users interact with a virtual iPhone. This virtual phone includes various functions such as adding contacts, sending messages, and viewing images in the gallery. Users can also use "Metube" to search for videos and "Goggle" to browse the web. Additionally, the phone allows users to play songs using "Spotifly," similar to Spotify, and even play games.
